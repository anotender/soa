    Russian billionaires are worth $104 billion more than they were last year, thanks to the recovery of commodity markets and an increase in the value of Russian currency. Many oligarchs got a boost on the heels of Donald Trump’s election as well. In total Russia’s 96 billionaires, including several connected to Vladimir Putin and at least one tied to Trump, are now worth a combined $386 billion, according to Forbes’ 2017 World’s Billionaires List.
